## This is the current text of the statement, it is not final and still in discussion.

## Your feedback is welcomed.


All of the major projects making up the Scientific Python stack now support
both Python 3.x and Python 2.7, and many projects have been supporting these
two versions of the language for several years. While we have developed tools
and techniques to maintain compatibility efficiently, it is a small but
constant friction in the development of a lot of code.

We are keen to use Python 3, and we currently accept the cost of writing
cross-compatible code to allow a smooth transition, but we don’t intend to
maintain this indefinitely. Although the transition has not been as quick as we
hoped, we do see it taking place, with more and more people using, teaching and
recommending Python 3.

The developers of the Python language extended support of Python 2.7 from 2015
to 2020, recognising that many people were still using Python 2. We believe
that the extra 5 years is sufficient, and our projects plan to stop supporting
Python 2 when upstream support ends in 2020, if not before. We will then be
able to simplify our code and take advantage of the many new features in the
current version of the Python language and standard library.

In addition, significantly before 2020, some of our projects will step down
Python 2.7 support to only fixing bugs, and make new feature releases which
require Python 3. This too parallels support for the language itself, as Python
2.7 releases only include bugfixes and security improvements.

Third parties may offer paid support for our projects on old Python versions
for longer than we support them ourselves. We won’t obstruct this, and it is a
core principle of free and open source software that this is possible. However,
if you enjoy the free, first party support for many projects in the Scientific
Python stack, please start planning to move to Python 3.

For all of these reasons, the following projects have pledged to **drop support for Python 2.7 no later than 2020**,
coinciding with the Python development team's [timeline for dropping support for Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0373/#update).
